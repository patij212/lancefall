# LANCEFALL — improvement loop devlog

Self-paced `/loop` ("10x keep improving the game, build marvelous creations").
One substantial, verified, committed improvement per iteration. Target ~10.

## Rough roadmap (adapt as I go)
1. Animated deep-space background — parallax starfield + drifting nebula
2. Score popups + kill-streak / combo-tier announcements
3. Game-over build recap (ship + perks) + build-aware share string
4. Daily Challenge surfacing (date, daily best, result)
5. Cosmetic palette themes (shard-unlockable reskins)
6. New content — a 4th ship or 3rd boss
7. Achievements / milestones + a lifetime-stats screen
8. Gated diegetic onboarding tutorial
9. Audio — adaptive boss music + SFX polish
10. Final balance/juice tuning + perf + docs refresh

## Log
<!-- newest last; each entry: iteration, what shipped, commit -->
- **Iteration 1** — Animated deep-space background: parallax twinkling starfield + drifting tinted nebula clouds (additive, combo-reactive heat), screen-space behind the camera so it stays calm. Readability preserved (dim, low-alpha). `render.ts` only.
- **Iteration 2** — Score juice: per-kill floating `+score` popups (tier-colored) and big center combo-milestone announcements (RAMPAGE→FRENZY→CARNAGE→UNSTOPPABLE→GODLIKE→LEGENDARY) with shake + flash + ding. Tier tracked per chain, resets on combo break. `game.ts`, `ui.ts`, `style.css`, `world.ts`.
- **Iteration 3** — Game-over build recap: shows the ship + every perk taken with stack counts (e.g. "LANCE · Long Lance×2, Chain Reaction×3"); the COPY SCORE share string now embeds the build too. `perks.ts` (describeStacks), `save.ts`, `game.ts`, `ui.ts`, `style.css`.
- **Iteration 4** — Daily Challenge surfacing: title caption "Daily Challenge · <date> · your best <n>" and an in-run "◆ DAILY" HUD badge so the seeded run is identifiable. `ui.ts`, `game.ts`, `style.css`.
- **Iteration 5** — Cosmetic palette themes (5: Neon/Sunset/Toxic/Vapor/Mono), shard-unlockable + persisted. Retints player ship, the UI accent (`--cyan`), and the nebula backdrop; enemies/bullets stay fixed for readability. Title palette swatch row. `themes.ts` (new), `render.ts`, `save.ts`, `game.ts`, `ui.ts`, `style.css`.
- **Iteration 6** — Third boss, THE BEACON: a brand-new hazard — a rotating diameter LASER that telegraphs → fires → rests while sweeping; lethal only when active, and dash i-frames phase you through it. Alternates Warden→Weaver→Beacon. Verified lethality (on-beam dies, off-beam safe, dashing safe). `tune.ts`, `types.ts`, `boss.ts`, `render.ts`, `game.ts`, `waves.ts`.
- **Iteration 7** — Achievements (12) + a lifetime-stats screen. Achievements evaluate on game-over against run + lifetime totals, toast on unlock; new STATS title screen shows lifetime totals + a got/locked achievement grid. `achievements.ts` (new, +tests), `save.ts`, `world.ts`, `game.ts`, `ui.ts`, `style.css`. 99 tests.
- **Iteration 8** — Roster 3 → 5 ships: TEMPEST (nimble — fast drift/accel, quick regen, slightly shorter dash) and PHANTOM (knife-edge — 1 stamina segment, fastest regen, 1.6× dash, +speed). Verified in-game stat application. `ships.ts` (+tests, 101 total).
- **Iteration 9** — Adaptive boss audio: a dissonant tritone tension voice fades into the drone while a boss is alive and out on death, plus a triumphant rising stinger when a boss falls. Lifecycle verified (added on spawn, removed on kill, no leaks). `audio.ts`, `game.ts`.
